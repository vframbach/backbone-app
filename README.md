# Backbone.js

##Introduction
Backbone.js is a lightweight Javascript front-end library. In a Javascript-heavy application, Backbone solves the problem of having a web of jQuery selectors and callbacks, and provides a streamlined way to keep data in sync.


Backbone has a hard dependency of [Underscore.js](http://underscore.js). Underscore.js is a Javascript utility/helper library.

##Backbone as compared alternative to Rails MVC

* Model - When an attribute is changed, an event is triggered, and the view is automatically updated. Similar to a rails model without class methods.
* Collection - A group of client-side models.
* View - Displays the model's state, listens for and renders any changes.
* Router - Maps urls to functions; similar to Rails routes.rb and Rails controller.
* Client-side templates - Renders HTML, like Rails .html.erb views.
